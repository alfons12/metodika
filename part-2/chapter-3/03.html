                    <h1 id="use-case">Use case</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we talked a lot about requirements and especcially emphasized that they can be of many different levels of abstraction and can be described using many techniques from process diagram through a simple free text sentence to a complex algorithm described by a formal code.</p>
<p>Therefore, stakeholders usually end up having a big bag of mixed requirements which are hard to understand. So analyst needs to analyze the requirements, create separat smaller bags and place them into it so that a requirements hierarchy is build which helps everybody to understand them faster. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p>We need a software for managing invoices</p>
<ul>
<li>Accountants must be able to create an invoice
<ul>
<li>System must automatically update grand total as the accountant adds invoice items</li>
<li>Accountant needs to select a customer from the registry of customers
<ul>
<li>System must provide an autocomplete function when entering a customer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>System must be able to export the invoice to PDF</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, when focusing purely on software requirements even such separation of requirements is not enough. For example a requirement <code>"User will be able to evaluate validity of an alert raised on contract"</code> is not an atomic step. It consists of many steps which together make an interaction between the user and the system. Such intraction captures a contract for the behaviour of the system which is crucial for understanding how the user intends to use the system. It describes what user wants to do in the system and the basic steps which are involved. The capability of the system together with the usage scenarion is called a <strong>use case</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language as an actor) and a system to achieve a goal.<br />
They describe the step by step process a user goes through to complete that goal using a software system.</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p>UC Evaluate validity of an alert on a contract</p>
<p>Desribes how the back office employee evaluates whether the automatically raised alert is positive or not based on analysis of the conditions in the contract</p>
<ol>
<li>User choose an alert from the list of alerts in a queue and opens it</li>
<li>System displays detail information of the alert and the unmet contract conditions which caused raising the alert</li>
<li>User goes through the conditions one by one, opens attached document associated with the condition, compares the document to the respective part of the contract and evaluates whether the condition is met or not and marks it accordingaly</li>
<li>User saves the changes</li>
<li>If ale conditions were met system deletes the alert and marks it ready for approval. If not the contract is assigned back to the front-desk employee which needs to solve the problem with the client.  </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Use cases are becoming more mainstream as a method for capturing requirements, as evidenced by the endorsement of big companies and methodologists such as Booch, Rumbaugh, and Coad. One benefit of use cases is that each one encapsulates a set of requirements. This encapsulation lets you easily manage and track the use cases individually and provides a better alternative to prose requirements. </p>
<p>Note: We don't aim to provide a comprehensive material covering everything about use cases. There are a lot of books and other material available, here we just want to emphesize what is important from the Effective analysis perspective. </p>
<h2 id="use-cases-purpose">Use cases purpose</h2>
<p>First, let's ask what is a use case? Is it a technique? Is it a type of requirement? Or even a requirement package? Well, it's all of it.</p>
<p>Typical use case scenario consists of number of steps where each of the steps are requirements themselves. Looking at the example above <code>System displays detail information of the alert</code> is a use case step and also a requirement what the system must be capable of. So a great benefit of use cases is they encapsulate a set of related requirements together which makes them great for organizing requirements coherently.  </p>
<p>Next, use case itself is also a requirement as it also represents what the system enables the user to do - in this case it enables user to evaluate if the automatically created alert is legitimate or not. Use cases shouldn't be duplicated by or converted to other forms of requriements, only supplemented by them.</p>
<p>Finaly, gathering and analysisng use cases, called use case analysis, is considered a mainstream method for capturing requirements. It helps describe what the user needs to be able to accomplish when using the system.    </p>
<p>TBD     :!: they help structure project planning information such as release dates, teams, priorities, and development status. - jo jo :-) Nebavme se ale jen o UC, behavioralni pozadavky obecne</p>
<h2 id="use-case-components">Use case components</h2>
<p>For each use case it is important to be clear what it does (Name and Description), who is the user performing the use case (Actor), and with which system the actor interacts (System/Boundary). </p>
<p>The core of the use case is obviously the scenario. To visualize use cases UML inlcudes a use case diagram. We'd like to emphasize that it is not a required part of you analysis. The only benefit is really just to visualize them so that it is clear what use cases are in scope of the system and which actors can perform particular use cases.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/usecases-03.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<h2 id="where-it-fits">Where it fits</h2>
<p>After creating a couple of use cases you quickly realize that it sometimes really tricky to distinguish what is a use case, what is its step etc. In other words, use cases share the same attribute with other types of requirements which is it can be described on many different levels of abstraction. </p>
<p>Use cases can be top level use cases such as <em>Start a mortgage deal</em> which represents a business goal or a long-running process, user goals such as <em>Create an invoice</em> which is actually what the user of the system wants to do with the system, or a low-level subfunction such as &quot;Add customer to the invoice&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/usecases-01.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use cases are neither business processes nor system functions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the level of detail aspect, many people also tell what is a use case based on it value to the user. There is an unwritten law that a requirement or a functionality is a use case only if it's worth for the user to turn on the computer to complete it. </p>
<p>This is why there are so many questions regarding what is a use case or what is not. The bad news is there is no rule or guidance hwo to recognize it. However, there are a couple of handy indicators:     </p>
<ol>
<li>Actor starting a use case is the only actor performing tasks within the use case (so it is not a process)</li>
<li>Actor starting a use case interacts only with the one system under which the use case belongs. The system can call other systems but this is not visible to the user (use case is a capability provided to user by one system)</li>
<li>Actor can finish the use case in one row in 2-20 minutes (this eliminates administrative/service use cases and long running processes) </li>
<li>Actor benefits from the use case even if it's performed many times in a row (this elliminates use cases not bringing much value to user)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/usecases-02.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<p>Looking at the use cases from this perspective use cases such us <em>Sign in</em>, <em>Sort items by name</em>, <em>Add note to a contract</em> or <em>Search customers</em>.</p>
<p><strong>User goal level</strong></p>
<p>The user goal level use cases effectively desribes the main behaviour the stakeholder expects from the system yet it still desribes enough detail for analysts break them down into more detailed artifacts and flows. </p>
<p>Use cases on higher levels than the user goal level provide values as well but the steps are too abstract for analyst to understand what the desired functions are. There is also a risk such use cases are processes including multiple systems which is not what analyst needs.   </p>
<p>The system subfunctions are also neccessary in order to have them developed, however they can't be placed on the same level as user goal use cases because for complex systems you would end up having houndreds of use cases which would make your specifications impossible to read and review. </p>
<p>The common characteristics of the system subfunctions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very simple - they usually can't be desribed using a scenario (<em>Mark email read</em>, <em>Filter contact list</em>)</li>
<li>They are not invoked by themselves but they are mostly part of other use case's scenario (<em>Find customer</em>)</li>
<li>They include implementation details or just calls a function or a service (&quot;Validate address&quot;) </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Use case is not every function or every user-system interaction desribed by scenario </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Requirements always change, if youve got good use cases though, you can usally change your sw quickly to adjust to those new requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>ano,  kazdej furt breci, ze se pozadavky  meni... ale spis se meni vnitrnosti detaily, cele use cases muzou taky, ale pak je to spis problem ze to nekdo totalne odflakl</li>
<li>a to je presne ono…kdyz mam use cases, najdu si tu funkci, najdu si co to ma delat, na jakych obrazovkach a zaznamenam zmenu</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subfunctions</strong></p>
<p>So how should the subfunctions be specified if they &quot;are not use cases&quot;? Subfunctions don't exist on their own so thei are always invoked from some use case or another subfunction. This answers where to put them.</p>
<p>Another question is whether to call them and model them as use cases. From the Effective analysis perspective there is only one kind of use case - user-goal. Everything else is just a step of the use case - an activity TBD link. The reason for this decision is that the practice has proved that including, parenting or allowing use case hierarchy always led to analysts having done functional decomposition. This should be avoided - TBD link avoid func decomp. Analysts then end up having dozens of use cases or using use cases as process steps which Effective analysis tries to eliminate. </p>
<p>On the other hand, at activity level the function decomposition doesn't mean a problem. Activities can shared by use cases, reused, broken down to details etc. </p>
<p>OBR FUNC decomp. activity    </p>
<p><strong>Secondary use cases</strong></p>
<p>It shouldn't be hard to recognize the user goal use cases if you use the basic rules listed in this section. You quickly learn that requirements such as <em>Filter contact list</em> or <em>Mark email read</em> are not good candidates to be included in user level use cases.  </p>
<p>However, despite you find the right level of abstraction and identify all use cases of the system you can't be sure that somebody will tell you that half of them actually are not use cases. This is because not all user goal use cases provides the same benefit to users. We call these use cases <em>secondary use cases</em> (service use cases or administrative use cases).</p>
<p>The common characteristics of the secondary use cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are invoked rarely - they are not the main system functions which user would use every day (<em>Reset forgotten password</em>)</li>
<li>If you removed them from the system it would remain functional yet limited (<em>Export list of invoices to CSV</em>)</li>
<li>They are simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions without any scenario (<em>Create product</em>, <em>Update product</em>, ...)</li>
<li>They are service/administrative functions such as <em>Update settings</em> or <em>Cancel long-running job</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Assessing the business value of the use cases is really a matter of taste and each use case needs to be assessed individually. </p>
<p>So how should the secondary use cases be specified if they &quot;are not use cases&quot;? Well, if they are user goals, they are also use cases. It must be documented who can invoke them and what is their purpose. Just separate them from the core primary use cases and don't spend much time documenting them in detail.  </p>
<p><strong>Business use cases</strong></p>
<p>TBD proces</p>
<h2 id="use-cases-and-other-requirements">Use cases and other requirements</h2>
<p>Despite being beneficial method for capturing behaviour of the system, use cases themselves are not enough as they can't describe the system from all angles. They won't tell you how the screens will look, what are the core algortightms and calculations, how fast the system should be or what securit constraints need to be implemented.
But, it can put all these facts together and serve as a hub which holds them coherently together. This help structure the requirements.   </p>
<p><img src="https://www.lukasvinter.net/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?cache=&amp;media=ba:uc_core.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p>By putting together it is not meant that all the requirements should be included in the use case specification. They must be only reference for two reasons. First, the use case specification would become enourmosly big and second, the artifacts such as screen, business rules etc. are very likely to be shared among multiple use cases and inlcuding them would duplicate them. </p>

<p><strong>TRAP</strong></p>
<p>You analyze use cases for a transportation company system which handles the status of each package. So far, you've writte scearios for these use cases: Create package, Set package status, Change package status. You present it to the stakeholders and one of them says: &quot;And we also need a report to see how many packages have not been delivered yet.&quot;</p>
<p>First confusion for analyst here is that stakeholders didn't tell analyst what he wants the system to do but instead what output the system shoudl produce. So analyst first needs to convert the requirement to a use case: &quot;Genetate a report of not delivered packages&quot;.</p>
<p>Another trap for analyst is that the report is not in the scope of the system being analyzed. The system shouldn't be responsible for creating such report which migh not be clear unless the analyst si familiar with the overall IT architecture of the organization. He needs to recognize, that this use case is a part of the overall solution but it is not a part of the system that is supposed to be build.</p>
<p>So, you always need to convert user-goal to a form of use case and decide in which system scope it should be place. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="use-case-realization">Use case realization</h2>
<p>Use cases scenarios should be detailed enough to describe how the user interacts with the system but they shouldn't uncover design decisions or implementation details such as which screens are opened, how the components of the system collaborate to fulfil use case's step etc.</p>
<p>However, as the analysis proceeds even these aspects of the system need to be described using use case realizations. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Use-case realization describes how a particular use case is realized within the design model, in terms of collaborating objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use case realizations define the design in terms of collaborating objects which support the use case.  Therefore, each use case realization is typically made up of a number of diagrams, most commonly sequence diagrams or activity diagrams, showing the collaboration or interaction between the participating objects.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use case step is a separate sub-usecase</strong>   </p>
<ol>
<li>User enters invoice basic data and <em>selects customer</em></li>
<li>User enters multiple line items, system updates the invoice total after adding each item</li>
<li>User ... </li>
</ol>
<p>Sub-function Add a customer to invoice</p>
<ol>
<li>User enters identification number or starts typing a customer name</li>
<li>System displays found customers</li>
<li>User selects a customer</li>
<li>System </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Use case step is an internal function call</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>User enters size and weight of the package</li>
<li>System calculates the <em>price of transportation</em></li>
<li>User ... </li>
</ol>
<p>Calculating price of transportation is calculated by the function performing the use case so it should be modeled using a function TBD odkaz and referenced from the use case. </p>
<p><strong>3. Use case step is a service call</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>User enters the address</li>
<li>System <em>verifies the address</em></li>
<li>User ... </li>
</ol>
<p>The system verifies the address through a service TBD odkaz provided by the external system running by the government.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use case refers to a screen</strong></p>

<p>By its nature use cases are effective technique during the initial anlaysis phase where analyst needs to understand the overall picture of the desired behaviour of the modeled system.
However, developers don't implement use cases. They implement screens, functions, interfaces, services and other more low-level artifacts. Similarly, the stakeholders can't think the required solution through on. They need to visual artifacts such as sreens, process diagrams or data models to realize the details and dependencies.</p>
<p>So, take use cases only as a first step to understand the scope and context but try to outline the design artifacts as soon as possible. Use cases will be thrown away or transformed to documentation overviews so don't spend much time tuning them. </p>

<h2 id="use-cases-and-documentation">Use cases and documentation</h2>
<p>Since use cases are a form of requirements they will not be part of deployed solution documentation (TBD odkaz Requirements and documentation), at least not all of them and in the form they were written during analysis.</p>
<p>Use cases as the high level system functions can be beneficial as a basis for a system overview. However, the overview should outline only the most important features so definitely not all use cases should be included. Also the form of use cases used during analysis is not suitable for documentation. The description should less structured and should be put in more &quot;documentational&quot; style.</p>
