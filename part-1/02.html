<p>Hopefuly, we've already emphasized strongly enough that each software needs to be aligned with business needs and business strategy, has to be analyzed and documented.</p>
<p>It is nothing worse when kicking off a project which was defined only by business people, project or account manager.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>REMEMBER</strong></p>
<p>Every project should be defined by a skilled business analyst who describes its goals and scope.</p>
<p>Letting business people or project manager do it might strike you in the future as you realize that clarifying ambiguous requirements, feature gaps and vague language requires you to spend additional time.</p>
<p>The project needs to stand on solid pillars not a liquid sand. The pillars might change a lot, for example in case of using agile process, but they always need to be clear to all stakeholders and aligned with the business need. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="analysts-responsibilities">Analyst's Responsibilities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Everybody says that analyst acts as a bridge between business people and IT people. However, person who only puts down what business said, transports it over the bridge and presents it to IT is not an analyst but rather a boatman/scribe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analyst helps business find solution to their business needs, designs the solution and in cooperation with development team evaluates whether the solution is feasible. </p>
<p>To succeed analysts need to</p>
<p><strong>Structure the business needs and ideas</strong></p>
<p>This means to transform the sentences which were recorded during meetings to graspable artifacts which can be further elaborated.</p>
<p>The essential part of analytical work is to <strong>structure</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't produce tons of texts. Analysts are not novelists, they are not even paid for letters typed.</p>
<p>They break the epic received from business down to simple structured ambigous sentences which can be easily transformed into system functions, prioritized and developed. </p>
<p>Analysts draw simple process diagrams or flow charts to depict to business the most important parts of the analyzed domain. They also draw screen scetches or data flows to show developers how the proposed solution should be transformed into the real application.</p>
<p><strong> Hlavní úkol analytika je odlišit úrovně abstrakce a vymezit odpovědnost </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>proces - rozbetlovat, at je to citelny pro business, pak dolu dobre pro vyvoj</li>
<li>co spada do kazdeho kroku procesu, systemu, spravne pojmenovat atd.</li>
</ul>
<p>TBD</p>
<p><strong> Analyze/elicit not gather </strong></p>
<p>TBD </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tohle je přesně ono <a href="https://www.batimes.com/articles/methods-for-eliciting-not-gathering-requirements.html">https://www.batimes.com/articles/methods-for-eliciting-not-gathering-requirements.html</a></p>
<p>TRAP
Requirements gathering vs requirements analýza.. 'připravíme ti to a pošleme'.. NE! musíte to analyzovat</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Ensure that both stakeholders and development team/s understands each other and the artifacts </strong></p>
<p>Experienced analyst verifies that understands what was said and that everybody understands the presented facts.
Alse never gets satisfied by the silince or by nodding stakeholder's heads as an approval. Always insist on active stakeholders' participation to ensure that they understand the solution and that thay considered all its consequences and alternatives.</p>
<p>Great analyst also don't rely on formal sign-offs because is aware of the fact that signing-off three-hundered-page-long system specification is just an alibi and has nothing to do with the real understanding of the solution. There must be a good relationship between analysts and stakeholders based on mutual understanding and trust therefore all changes, features and other artifacts were thoroughly discussed, understood and the sign off is just a formality. Workign in an atmosphere of distrust does not benefit anyone! </p>
<p><strong> Analyst is thoroughgoing</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Analysts don't assume therefore doesn't use &quot;It is clear...&quot;, &quot;It is implicated&quot;</li>
<li>Analysts deal with border cases, missign facts and conditions right away because understands that it is easier to solve the gaps now than to hunt the informatins later when the people are gone, implementation has already started and the team is running out of time</li>
<li>Analysts are conrete and accurate and don't give anybody space to speculate
<ul>
<li>They don't use &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;etc.&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, &quot;none&quot;, they always list all the possibilities</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> Responsibility to build the trust </strong></p>
<p>Along with the managers (project manager, account mannager etc.), analysts are people who interacts with stakeholders most and therefore form the relatioships with the stakeholders.</p>
<p>Their attitude to stakeholders very much influences the stakeholders' view of the whole vendor be it external vendor or interna IT department.</p>
<p>So the analyst</p>
<ul>
<li>is always professional and nice</li>
<li>is always well groomed and adequately dressed</li>
<li>never lies</li>
<li>is never rdue</li>
<li>always as a partner and is helpful </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dedicated-analyst">Dedicated analyst</h2>
<p>Whether to have a person who is responsible only for analysis on the project depends very much on the project, its size and complexity both in terms of complexity of business domain and ambiguity of the scope and goals.</p>
<p>We also need to distinguish between business analysis and systems analysis. It is definitely a plus when the system anlayst/specialist understands the business domain, the business needs and at the same time has a knowledge of the system impacted by the proposed solution, can test interfaces provided by the system and is able to modify data in its database.</p>
<p>These people often can interact with both business people and development team, can structure information and facilitate meetings. But being more IT-oriented they don't mostly care about the business value provided by the solutions, they often put themselves in a postition &quot;Tell me what you want to implement, we will analyze it and come back with questions about the details.&quot;. </p>
<p>They like to have a solution which they then analyze, unlike business anlaysts who creates the solutions.</p>
<p>But there is a line behind which it is impossible to not have a dedicated analysts. In fact, the line is approxmatelly aligned with line which separates projects which require proper dedicated business analysis and those which don't.</p>
<p>There are projects which are complex, it is not clear what solution will best fulfill the business need and which impacts dozens of systems and processes.</p>
<p>These projects requires analysts who are almost subject-matter experts, who excel in moderating meetings, negotating requirements, solution evaluation and scope definition. These skills are more valuable for them then knowledge of SQL.</p>
<p>Considering the amount of knowledge and skills analysts need to know nowadays plus more and more complex business domain and the number of regulations which are required from the corporations it is not likely that we will see dedicated analysts to disappear. It is very likely to be the opposite.
Having said that, it is definitely necessary for analysts to be up to date with current technologies, be aware of basic architectural concepts and softare engineering in general. It helps them forsee the problems right in early stages of the project, make better decisions and also they are respected in the development team! </p>
<h3 id="generalizing-specialist">Generalizing specialist</h3>
<p>Opinions about the importance of the dedicated analyst on projects differes. While on classic waterfall projects the split of roles is common the agile community doesn't see a neccessity for such dedicated role and prefers rather T-skilled people, so called generalizing specialists (TBD Ambler). These people are not specialized only in one discipline they has technical skills and knowledge of both software development an business domain.</p>
<p>As we are in favor of T-skilled people it is and always be a sci-fi to think that a developer in a huge corporation jumps out from the keyboard, change his Linux t-shirt for a well-fitted shirt and goes analyze a huge regulatory requirement influencing almost all departments in the corporation. They simply don't have the right skills and they don't really need to. Most developers just enjoy coding and they don't give a hack to talk to some guys in suits sitting upstairs.</p>
<p>It is indisputable that having such individuals in a team is a great benefit.
Having such colleague who knows everything about e-commerce, is able to define business need and transform it to technical specification and also is able to write SQL or read Java code is a dream.
But considering the current demand for IT people which abolutely exceeding supply makes the dream a chimera.</p>
<h2 id="becoming-an-analyst">Becoming an analyst</h2>
<h3 id="systems-analysts">Systems analysts</h3>
<p>Systems analyst are very close to development, they very often knows the underlying technologies, do system design or architecture and performs system tests.
For this reason it is not very common that this role would be held by non-technical people. Systems analysts are either former software engineers or people holding a degree in computer science but not enjoying the actual developent that much.</p>
<h3 id="business-analysts">Business analysts</h3>
<p>It is not that straightforward fro business analysts. BAs don't need to have a deep knowledge of technologies and software engineering hence this role may be held also by people coming from business area.</p>
<h4 id="from-a-developer">From a developer</h4>
<ul>
<li>(+) Analytical and structured thinking</li>
<li>(+) Knowledge of software engineering</li>
<li>(-) Needs to learn business domain</li>
<li>(-) Needs to learn various soft skills</li>
<li>(-) Tendency to dive into much details very early which is unnecessary and requires more time for analysis </li>
<li>(-) Tendency to propose technically best solutions not providing the best value to the business </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Having previous development experience is critical for a BSA because it grounds them in reality.</p>
<p>-- Ambler</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="from-a-systems-analyst">From a systems analyst</h4>
<p>The pros and cons are almost the same as for converting from a developer, thank to the the previous experience with requiremetns engineering, meetings facilitation etc. systems analyst might be able to be productive faster.  </p>
<h4 id="from-a-business-person">From a business person</h4>
<p>Former business person has the advantage of having deep knowledge of the business area, processes and methodolgies in the organization as well as they are aware of the information systems and applications.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even though they are able of abstract thinking, they lack most of IT skills. As we already mentioned and will list there are nontrivial number of principles, artifacts, techniques and tools which great analysts need to know. By hard studying and a lot of experience even a former business people can become a rockstar analyst.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong> TRAP</strong></p>
<p>Don’t assume that any talented developer or knowledgeable user can automatically be an effective business analyst without training, resource materials, and coaching.
-- Karl Wiegers p. 69</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, in reality these conversions mostly don't work. These analyst can't catch up with the amount of knowledge IT people got at university, they prefer textual specifications to diagramatic representation which makes their documents hard to read. Architecture sessions are not understandable for them, considering words such as server or web service rude words.</p>
<p>Lacking the essential IT skills they need to always discuss the solution from the system perspective with systems analysts which slowers everything down. </p>
<p>It is one of the goals of Efective analysis to present a analytical minimum so that the anlaysts may be confident they use modern techniques and tools without the need to study dozens of different books and other resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>!!!</strong>
The responsibility of analyst is not to write down what business said and transform it a specification for developer. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Former business people, howver, could be beneficial when there are a lot various requests from business which need to be filter and put into context. We can call it pre-analysis. Whether it is economical to have such roles in the company that is another story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is far more easier and effective to convert an IT guy to a business analyst then a business guy.</p>
<p>Why? Learning accounting and facilitating meeting is easier than learning analytical structured thinking, data modeling and basic knowledge of software engineering.</p>
