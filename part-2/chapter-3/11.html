                    <h1 id="roles-rights">Roles, rights</h1>
<p>Privilege is a low-level, granular user authority to do or see something in the system.</p>
<p>Role is a collection of privileges so if the user has some role he has all the privileges associated to that role.</p>
<p>Each system functionality is then tight to a privilege or a role so you can state that &quot;The button is enabled if the logged in user has a role 'Warehouse administrator'&quot; or &quot;The button is enabled if the logged in user has a ‘Delete contact’ privilege”.</p>
<p>The list of privileges in the system is fixed because evaluation of the privilege is in the source code for example &quot;The button is enabled if the logged in user has a ‘Delete contact’ privilege’”. The code deciding whether to enable the button or not must be able to reference the privilege. On the other hand, roles are added or removed adhoc, they are just privileges containers and don’t even need to exist when the system is released. So in practice the evaluation of the condition above would first get user’s role, then get all privileges of that role and evaluates if ‘Delete contact’ is among them. </p>
<p>Therefore documentation can’t state something like “Only branch manager can only do this” because this can’t be mapped to a system privilege. The reason why it is tempting to include roles in the documentation is that in the early phases the system requirements works with roles. For example actors during use case analysis are very similar to roles. But once you switch from requirements to the real system artifacts, roles are not sufficient and the concept of privileges must be introduced.</p>
<p><strong>Why we need to define privileges</strong></p>
<p>Because it must be clear who has the authority to do or see something in the system. Analyst also need to define which functions will be restricted to particular privileges and which will be available to anyone as this can be changed without coding in the future.</p>
<p>During analysis stakeholders work with “business roles” and say for example “Only sales manager can display report R12”. This enables analyst to get the idea who does what in the company but is not related to system privileges at all. The actual ability to display the report will be ruled by a privilege even though the privilege will probably be included in the role “Sales manager”.
From the system perspective there will be a privilege “Display report R12” controlling that only users having this privilege will be authorized to display the report.</p>
<p><strong>Role, Actor, User</strong></p>
<p>While actor is a business role (part of the domain), role is a technical artifact implemented in the actual system. Even though there is a big overlap and many actors discovered during (use case) analysis will be present in the developed system as roles, they are different concepts serving different purpose. Actors help analyst to discover how the requirements are spread among different user class. They should not be used to define what somebody could do or can’t. This is why we don’t recommend to use actor inheritance as it tempts analysts to think system-level instead of focusing on just requirements.</p>
<p>Roles on the other hand represent system artifacts implemented in the actual concept.</p>
<p>For example you might work throughout whole analysis with the assumption that only legal department is an actor associated to the use case “Start a case with a debtor”. In fact, this function will be available only to senior lawyers and the head of the department but this information is more detailed than needed as the aim of the use case analysis is to discover the main features. </p>
<p>On the other hand if you’re working on a change request to a legacy system which has the roles and privileges in place, you can start with only an actor in the beginning but the development team will want to know what role can perform the new task and if a new privilege is needed to be implemented.</p>
<p>TBD OBR Pobockar zaklada uver...uvnitr jsou dva kroky a kazdy dela jina role, ale furt jeden actor</p>
<h2 id="antipatterns">Antipatterns</h2>
<p><strong>Privileges in requirements, actors in documentation</strong></p>
<p>As stated before, both concepts actors and roles/privileges serve different purpose and you should use them on the right level. Therefore you shouldn’t have anything like this in your analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use case step: &quot;User fills in the form and submits it. If the user has a privilege 'PRIV12-No need to verify data', no checkings are done on the submitted data&quot;. Let us reming you the role from the chapter covering the use cases TBD that they should not include any implementation details. Privileges are implementation details and should not be in the use case scenario. If you work on a change request and you both need to understand the flow of a new use case and you know the particualar privilege or role, note it in the use case but not in the scenario.</li>
<li>Button detail: &quot;The button is enabled only if the user is a member of the Legal department&quot;. If you give this to the developer the first question will be what role in the system is the legal department. In system specification you need to specify the concrete privilege or role.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Roles hierarchy</strong></p>
<p>Stakeholders very often work with “roles inheritance”. We often hear them say “Branch supervisor and higher can approve the change”. First, you need to remove the ambiguity and specify the actors properly: “Branch supervisor, branch manager and overall branch manager can approve the change”. This will allow you to model the requirement properly on the business level. </p>
<p>In the end the requirement will probably be implemented as a privilege to “approve the change” assigned to roles Branch supervisor, branch manager and overall branch manager.</p>
<p>Note: Always try to avoid using actor inheritance when modeling requirements with use cases as it makes them harder to read by business people and switches your mind to more system level thinking. The only purpose of actor inheritance is to make use case diagram more readable when two different actors share many use cases but not all of them. Use case models were not intended to model roles or organization structure. </p>
