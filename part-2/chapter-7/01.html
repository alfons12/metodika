<blockquote>
<p>A process is a set of activities that interact to achieve a result. Activity is something which is done by an actor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>BPMN/UML</strong></p>
<p>Mostly, processes are described in either BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) notation or using UML Activity diagrams TBD odkaz</p>
<p>Despite being very similar, BPMN, as the names indicates, is great to model business process, activity diagrams on the other hand excels in more low-level modeling. Having said that, in most cases it doesn’t matter which one you choose. </p>
<p>BPMN - If you do a lot of high-level business process modeling, use BPMN. It allows you to indicate whether the step is performed by a human or by the system, it is easier to show time events and document exchanges.
Activity diagrams are more suitable for modeling algorithms and processes which heavily involves IT systems. </p>
<p>If you don’t have a valid reason not to do so, use activity diagrams. You will benefit from using one notation on all levels and the stakeholders will not be confused with another notation.</p>
<p><strong>Levels of abstraction</strong></p>
<p>From this definition it is clear that a process can represent anything from a use case scenario to mortgage flow. Again, the practice of separating levels of abstraction kicks in. You need to decide what you want to achieve with the process model. Do you want to describe the business process (pod carou: activities that produce a specific service or product for customers. It is not 100%  correct but for a sake of simplification we call a process model business when it is independent on IT systems. No system is mentioned in the process at all - YES“Calculate bonus”, “Calculate bonus in Bonusea system”). Or do you want to describe what step is performed in what system within a single business process step?</p>
<p>When you draw the process it’s up to you what detail it will include, on what level of abstraction it will be, but you should choose it and stick with it.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about not mixing levels of abstraction, including systems performing particular business process steps is an antipattern. In other words, the business process should remain unchanged even if the underlying systems change. However, in the real world the the business processes are so dependend on the IT infrastructure that unless the diagram is meant for high management we always include the systems as it helps detect dependecies.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Layout, swim lanes</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/process-model-01.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<p>We think that it is without debate that this process could be improved a lot. Even though it sticks,to a certain extent, with one level of abstraction it is not readable comfortably</p>
<p>First, layout influences the readability greatly. Always tried to eliminate line crossings as much as you can and put connected activities close to each other.</p>
<p>Second, you might have spotted that the author also tried to show in which system the particular step is performed. This is common requirement and for this purpose process/activity diagrams includes a concept of swimm lanes/partitions so please use them. They are great for indicating who whether it’s a department, particular role or some IT system.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/process-model-02.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<p><strong>Just basics</strong></p>
<p>Unless you work in environment when everybody is focused on processes and are experts in this field, always. As we mentioned earlier, business people are able to pick up different notations quickly but only to some extent. Honestly, we also don’t know all the gateway types in BPMN so don’t expect your stakeholders to learn them. Use lightweight models which are easy to draw and easy to understand - TBD ambler</p>
<p><strong>Usages</strong></p>
<p>Process models are great in sitations when you are facing a complex change in your organization and you simply can't forsee the impacts and implications, when you're implementing a change request impacting many different systems and you need to examine the impacts or when you're implementing a big system where use case analysis would lead to hundreds of them therefore would be more detail for a first step.</p>
<p>In these situations mapping the high-level processes, their input outputs and impacted departments and systems is the best choice to perform as the frist step. You always need two sets of models, the As-is and To-Be.</p>
<p>For the As-Is it doesn't matter what quality they would have as long as they provide the value and are understandable to all stakeholders. They are only temporary and will be thrown away once the new system is deployed.</p>
<p>The To-Be models on the other hand will provide value even after the deployment. The effort having been put to creating them isn't usually low so it would be pity not to keep them and use them in the future.
However not all of them should be kept and maintained and some sophisticated tool which also stores models metadata should be used for drawing the models planned to be made permanent. We talk about this in more detail in the chapter dedicated to the documentation - TBS SPec vs. Doc</p>
