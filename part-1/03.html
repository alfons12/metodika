<p>Throughout the whole text we've presented so far, we repeatedly ephasized that analysis is a complex activity which has many levels of abstraction.</p>
<p>Each of these levels requires analyst to have different kind of knowledge, posses different skills, use different techniques and tools. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/basa-activities.png" alt="aa" /> </p>
<p>Attentive reader may object that the image slightly distorts reality because we stated in the begining that business context and IT context of the analysis can't be separated in one particular point.</p>
<p>Yes, the strict separation of activities between business analyis and systems analysis is not accurate, however here it is just for the purpose of simplification.</p>

<p><strong>A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide)</strong></p>
<p>Author: International Institute of  Business Analysis </p>
<p>BABOK is the globally recognized standard for the practice of business analysis. BABOK Guide reflects the collective knowledge of the business analysis community and presents the most widelyaccepted business analysis practices. (TBD Wikipedia)</p>
<ul>
<li>It defines the skills and knowledge that people who work with and employ business analysts should expect a skilled practitioner to demonstrate.</li>
<li>It describes the business analysis tasks that must be performed to deliver a solution that will provide value to the sponsoring organization.</li>
<li>It describes the skills, knowledge, and competencies required to perform business analysis effectively. It does not describe the processes that people will follow to do business analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>BABOK is a comprehensive source covering all aspects of the business analysis. Analysts will learn what it means to do business analysis, how to be a good BA.
The main eye-opening fact in BABOK for many</p>
<p>However BABOK is rather theoretical summary of the subject, showing what is in scope of the analysis and what can be used but doesn't show anlaysts how, when and why use the particular technique, tool or produce particular artifact.</p>
<p><strong>Software Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Author: Karl Wiegers, Joy Beatty </p>
<p>For many, inlcuding us, this is a Bible of software analysis. It is simply an essential reading for everybody who is serious about analyzing software.</p>
<p>Many of the appraches presented in Effective analysis stems from or build upon the ideas Karl presented in his book. </p>
<p><strong> Agilemodeling.com</strong></p>
<p>Author: Scott Ambler</p>
<p>Despite the agile indicator in the name this website </p>
<p>The agile community has been for some time already presenting many The most significant is its influence in software development area where the most known agile methodology Scrum is used by thousands of teams around the world. </p>
<p>What Scott did is he moved the agile practices beyond the software development process. He applies the principles of agile to the analysis and modeling showing how to do the analysis more lightweight, not producing useless specifications and models which are too formal and hard to read.</p>
<p>This also inspired Effective analysis a lot. </p>
<p><strong> Writing effective use cases</strong></p>
<p>Author: Alistair Cockburn</p>
<p>Use cases (TBD link use cases)</p>
<p>Despite they are often replaced with more lightweight approaches in agile methodologies (user stories for example) they still represents most popular way of gathering user requirements for the software.</p>
<p>Technique which seems crystal clear in the beginning is never-endign source of misconceptions and misunderstandign between development teams.
They are often called somethign they are not and abused for something they weren't designed for. </p>
<p>Alistair presents in his book what type of use cases there are, when they are useful and when they should be avoided and also tips for writing effective use case.  </p>
<p><strong> UML, BPMN, ArchiMate…</strong></p>
<p>Modeling languages are here to help analysts, developers, architects and other team members to in unified standardized way.</p>
<p>Even most diagrams were developed to help communicate IT people we are always surprised how quickly business people can learn to read these models (ssuming they are high-level without technical details).</p>
<p>Having said that even though we're in favor of lightweight models we don't see any point in prefering general Visio scetches to standardized diagrams which can be reused later on in detailed IT design. </p>
<p>We will elaborate this topic more in its own chapter. (TBD kapitola)</p>
<p><strong> Data modeling</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-is-missing">What is missing</h2>
<p>There are a lot of approaches, techniques and guidlines which help analysts understands the problem domain and structure relevant information.</p>
<p>What we miss with the current resources is two things.</p>
<p>First, there is no binding agent. Analysts are experts at processes, use cases, wireframes and so on however analysis of these artifacts is done mostly separately with no relationships to each other. It is then very hard to see the whole picture.</p>
<p>Second, despite analysis being a discipline which always differ from project to project, from comapny to company and no unified process can ever be inveted, anlaysts would benefit from having a unified set of artifacts produced by analytical activities and unified approach how to interconnect these artifacts so that it is easy to seemlesly navigate between different levels of abstraction and to orient in the whole problem domain more efficiently. </p>
<p>All the resources above presents ideas but implementation of these ideas is left to analysts. This leads to the situation that every single team understands the guidelines differently and it requries significant effort to orient in new project. Let alone it sometimes is simply wrong. </p>
<p>The typical advice presented by the listed resources migh look like this:
<em>Depending on the nature of your environment a couple of diagrams drawn on a whiteboard that are updated as the project goes along may be sufficient. Or perhaps several diagrams drawn using a CASE tool is what you need. Or perhaps the same diagrams supported with detailed documentation is required. Different projects have different needs.</em></p>
<p>This leads to inconsistent analytical outputs, misunderstood advices and very painful work with analysis outputs.</p>
<p>The result from this situation is frustration whose main reasons are elaborated in the next chapter.   </p>
<h2 id="example-plane-tickets-aggregator">Example: Plane tickets aggregator</h2>
<p>Let's demonstrate what analytical work involves and what techniques are common during analysis on an real life example. </p>
<p>John works as an analyst for a big company offering service to compare fares and order plane tickets from various airlines.
The company started a few months ago selling plane tickets from American Airlines. After a successful negotiations they are newly approved to resell tickets provided by United Airlines.</p>
<p>John was presented this business need: <strong>We want to start selling plane tickets also from United Airlines.</strong> </p>
<p><strong> Phase 1 </strong></p>
<p>First, business analysis scheduled a meeting with the sponsor of this request and gathered additional details:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tickets should be sold through all current digital channels - website and mobile application</li>
<li>Selling should be roled out on 20/1/2018</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> Phase 2 </strong></p>
<p>This is a typical example where there is not much space for analysts for proposing different solutions since the solution is given: it is requried to enable company website and its mobile application to sell tickets from United Airlines.</p>
<p><strong> Phase 3 </strong></p>
<p>To refresh his knowledge of the process when buying a plane ticket John created a high-level process description. He also highlighted the Search plane tickets step which is going to be changed because there will be tickets from United Airlines included in the search results.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/buy-plane-tickets-process.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<p><strong> Phase 4 </strong></p>
<p>Once John discovered what process part is impacted and which needs to be changed, he should now identify which information systems are involved in the impacted process steps.</p>
<p>John verified there are really only two applications selling tickets to customers - website and mobile application.</p>
<p>Following represents the functionality which allows user to search for the tickets and which need to reflect the new functionality to newly search for tickets provided by United Airlines. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/order-plane-tickets-uc.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<p><strong> Phase 5 </strong></p>
<p>By entering this phase 5 John's work switches to system level and he starts discovering concrete impacts to concrete systems functions.</p>
<p>In this case we talk about the function &quot;Search plane tickets&quot; which needs to be changed to include also plane tickeds from United Airlines.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/search-plane-tickets.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<p>It is easy to see from the diagram that within Search plane tickets function the main backend system called Alfa will newly call a service exposed by United Airlines and will provide client applications with aggregated results from both airlines.</p>
<p>Adding the ability to search United Airlines plane tickets must be reflected also in the system databases. John discovered that sold plane tickets has an attribute indicating the company from which it was bought. This attribute needs to be extended.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/plane-tickets-class.png" alt="aa" />  </p>
<p>With the described example above we went through all phases of the analytical work which analysts should be able to perform. The intention wasn't to dictate any particular modeling technique or notation, the purpose of the example was to ilustrate that good analysts are able to understand the business need and through various techniques using his anlaytical skills break down the problem, uncover individual impacts and design working solution which is aligned with the business need on one hand and is also well prepared for development on the other.</p>
