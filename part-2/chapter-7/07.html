                    <h1 id="data-models">Data models</h1>
<p>Irrespective of whether you do high-level business analysis or you prepare it is more than important for analyst to know data modelng. A great portition of analytical activities is decribing and manipulating data on different levels of abstractin.</p>
<p>Business analysts focus rather on modeling and understanding the real world terms found in the particular area of interest and their relationships such as Customer, Product or Order in the domain of e-commerce.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/domain-model.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<p>System analysts on the other hand model more technical aspects of the data: for example classes and associations when designing an object-oriented system or tables and relations when defining how the data will be stored in the realtion database.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/class-diagram.png" alt="aa" />
<img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/erd.png" alt="aa" /></p>
<p>This layering is defined by ANSI there are three kinds of data models:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual data model : describes the semantics of a domain, being the scope of the model. For example, it may be a model of the interest area of an organization or industry. This consists of entity classes, representing kinds of things of significance in the domain, and relationship assertions about associations between pairs of entity classes. A conceptual schema specifies the kinds of facts or propositions that can be expressed using the model. In that sense, it defines the allowed expressions in an artificial 'language' with a scope that is limited by the scope of the model.</li>
<li>Logical data model : describes the semantics, as represented by a particular data manipulation technology. This consists of descriptions of tables and columns, object oriented classes, and XML tags, among other things.</li>
<li>Physical data model : describes the physical means by which data are stored. This is concerned with partitions, CPUs, tablespaces, and the like.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The conceptual data model is mostly represented by a high-level class diagram whereas the logical data model reflects the technology used on the project.
Thus it could be a class model in case of implementation in an object-oriented technology such as Java or C# or a entity-relationship model which shows the design of atabase tables, its attributes and relationships if analysts design how the data will be stored in the relation database.  </p>
<p><img src="http://www.effective-analysis.com/generated/resources/models-01.png" alt="aa" /> </p>
<p>Note: ER model is is sometimes incorrectly called a physical data model. <em>The physical design of a database involves deep use of particular database management technology. For example, a table/column design could be implemented on a collection of computers, located in different parts of the world. That is the domain of the physical model.</em><br />

<p><strong> Class diagram or ERD diagram</strong></p>
<p>If the system being designed is implemented in the object-oriented technology such as Java or C# but the data are going to be stored in the relational database analysts often grope which model to create: the object model, ER model or both?</p>
<ol>
<li>Analyst starts with an object model. This model needs to be transfered to relation model. This can be done automaticlaly using development tools or manually</li>
<li>Analyst creates directly the relation model. Developers then need to create the object representation to manipulate the data in the application. Again, either using tools or manually.</li>
<li>Analyst can create both</li>
</ol>
<p>Important note here is, that both models needs to be synchronized so that it is clear which data from the object model maps to which parts of the relation model. If this is not done the models have no benefit.</p>
<p><strong> Good practices for data modeling </strong></p>
<p>Data modeling is a well documented discipline and it is not our intention to reinvent the wheel and explain what can be found on the internet or in books. Instead, we just present only a couple of practices which are rather basic yet not followed by many analysts according to our experience. </p>
<ol>
<li>Each entity must have a self-explanatory name, a noun. For example <em>Car, Order, Account, Contact</em></li>
<li>Each entity must have a short ambigous description clarifying the meaning of the entity from the business perspective (unless it is a purely technical table for example) which also sets rules what the instances of the entity are and what aren't. It may also include overview info such as what triggeres creation of the entity, who are the typical users etc. For example <em>Accounts are organizations with which the company has a relationship</em> or <em>&quot;Contacts are individual people with whom the company has a relationship. Often contacts are related to an account, but certain organizations and businesses may serve or sell to individual consumers, and so most of the contacts will not be under accounts.&quot;</em></li>
<li>Don't include its state machine, events or business rules into the description. This information must always be referenced. For example &quot;When the Order is not paid within 48 hours after creating, it is cancelled.&quot;  </li>
<li>The same rules apply for the attributes among entities. For example <em>Contact:Mobile &quot;Represents a person's mobile phone number. Only one mobile phone number is supported so it can be home, work or any other type.&quot;</em></li>
<li>The same rules apply entity relationships. For example <em>&quot;Account--&gt;Contact [m:n] relationship: Individual contacts(people) working for an account(organization). An organization employes many people (including 0) and a single person can work simultanously for multiple organizations (or even 0).&quot;</em> </li>
<li>Always include an example for both entities and relationships. For example <em>&quot;Contact John Smith working for IBM&quot;</em>.</li>
